# Security Policy

Catbee Technologies is committed to maintaining the security and integrity of all our tools, libraries, and open-source projects.  
This repository defines the **default security policy for the entire organization**, applying to all Catbee repositories unless overridden.

---

## 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a **security vulnerability** in any Catbee Technologies project:

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
- **Do not** disclose the issue publicly.
- Please send a detailed report to:  
  **hprasath.dev@gmail.com**

Include, when possible:

- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Potential impact  
- Any suggested fixes or mitigation ideas  

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe.

---

## 🛡️ Scope

This policy covers:

- All public repositories under the **Catbee Technologies organization**
- Libraries, utilities, toolkits, CLIs, and platform components
- Build pipelines, configuration files, and published packages

It does **not** cover:

- Deprecated or archived repositories  
- Third-party dependencies used in Catbee projects  
- Security issues unrelated to Catbee-managed code  

For documentation-only repositories, the impact surface is typically low, but the same private reporting process should be followed if you believe a configuration or deployment-related vulnerability exists.

---

## 🔧 Supported Projects

Security updates are provided as needed for actively maintained repositories.

Projects that are marked as:

- **Archived**
- **Unmaintained**
- **Legacy**

may not receive security patches.

Refer to each repository’s README for maintenance status.

---

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that researchers:

1. Give us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue  
2. Avoid exploiting the vulnerability  
3. Avoid accessing user data  
4. Do not run automated scanners against production systems  

We appreciate all responsible security efforts that help make our ecosystem safer.
